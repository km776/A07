			<blockquote> "Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless." </blockquote>
		<h2> Our Ticket Packages </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Season Package: $95</li>
				<li>Patron Package: $200</li>
				<li>Single Speaker: $25</li>
			</ul>
